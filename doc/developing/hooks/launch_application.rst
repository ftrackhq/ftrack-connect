*************************
ftrack.launch-application
*************************

The *launch-application* hook is triggered from the ftrack interface when a user
selects an application in the :guilabel:`Launch` menu. For more information
about launching applications from the web UI, see 
:ref:`ftrack:using/connect/launch_application`.

The list of applications is provided by the 
:ref:`developing/hooks/get_applications` :term:`hook`. The *get-applications*
hook provides a list of applications with ``applicationIdentifier`` and
optionally ``applicationData``. These parameters are passed to this hook and
should be used to launch the correct application.

The default hook is a placeholder and should be extended to include correct
application commands.

Example event passed to hook::

    Event(
        topic='ftrack.launch-application',
        data=dict(
            applicationIdentifier='maya-2014',
            applicationData=dict(
                foo='bar'
            ),
            context=dict(
                selection=[
                    dict(
                        entityId='eb16970c-5fc6-11e2-bb9a-f23c91df25eb',
                        entityType='task'
                    )
                ]
            )
        )
    )

Expects reply data in the form::

    dict(
        success=True,
        message='maya-2014 launched successfully.'
    )
