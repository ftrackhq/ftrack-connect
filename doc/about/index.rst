About
*****

ftrack connect is all about connecting ftrack to other systems and providing
tighter integration into your everyday workflows.

It revolves around a service, installed locally onto each individuals machine,
that provides enhanced functionality for the web interface including launching
applications, notifications, local action processing and multi-site as well as
generic interfaces for logging time and publishing any kind of data into ftrack.

This package contains that core service and standalone applications. Specific
integrations with other applications are named following the convention
*ftrack-connect-[application]* and are available separately. In the not too
distant future you will be able to install and configure those separate
integrations directly from within both the ftrack web interface and also this
core system.
