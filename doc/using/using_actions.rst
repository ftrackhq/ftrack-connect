******************************
Using integrations and actions
******************************

The pre-built packages installed from the `Integrations webpage
<https://www.ftrack.com/portfolio/connect>`_ contains a set of integrations with
different creative applications. These integrations can be launched directly
from Connect or the ftrack web interface through the use of Actions.

Connect provides an interface in the standalone application to run your actions.
Actions in ftrack provide a standardised way to integrate other tools, either
off-the-shelf or custom built, directly into your ftrack workflow.

Using actions you can, for example, launch applications for a task you are
working on, generate a custom report or generate your entire filesystem
structure for a project with one click.

Launching actions in Connect
============================

.. note::

    If any task is assigned to your user, these will be appearing as part of the drop down, to be easily accessibles.

To launch an action, select an entity for which to launch the action and press
the action in the list below.

Actions are grouped based on their label and a context menu will be shown if 
multiple variants are available.

    You can also launch actions from the web interface.

.. _using/actions/limitations:

Limitations
===========

Connect will currently only list actions available in the running process and
will therefore not include actions running on any remote servers.

Actions in connect does currently not support custom UI. You will see an error
message if you try to run an action which returns an UI configuration.
