Managing Integrations
*********************

Connect ships with a :ref:`ConnectWidget` made to visually manage your integrations,
which can be used to install and update them from local as well as remote sources.

.. note::

    The User Plugin Manager widget will manipulate ONLY locally installed to the user.
    Will not discover, look or manage centrally installed plugins.


Start Up
========
When Connect startup it'll check for the integrations available locally as well as remote, and present with various options.
Plugins which can be updated, will be automatically be checked.

.. warning::

    ftrack Connect requires to be restarted after plugins have been installed.



Customizations
==============

Currently the remote list of plugins is contained in a json encoded file hosted on `ftrack S3 bucket <https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ftrack-deployment/ftrack-connect/plugins/plugins.json>`_
This path can be overwritten using the environment variable **FTRACK_CONNECT_JSON_PLUGINS_URL**, which will have to point to a json containing the full path to where
your integrations and plugins are hosted.

The content of the json will have to contain a key named *integrations* which will host the full paths.


.. code:: json

    {
        "integrations":[
            "https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ftrack-deployment/ftrack-connect/plugins/ftrack-application-launcher-1.0.1.zip",
            [etc....]
        ]
    }
