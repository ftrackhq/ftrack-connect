# ******* DEPRECATED REPOSITORY *******
We are currently moving our repositories to a new monorepo structure <https://github.com/ftrackhq/integrations>. 
That monorepo is currently private during the migration, but we will open it
publicly as soon as we can.
Meanwhile, we will not do any new updates in the current repository.

Contact support for any inquiries: [support@ftrack.com](mailto:support@ftrack.com)
