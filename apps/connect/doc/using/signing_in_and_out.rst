Signing In & Out

To use the service, you need a valid `ftrack <http://www.ftrack.com>`_ account.

Signing In
==========

The first time you launch the service (or after you have logged out previously)
you will be prompted to sign in to your ftrack server.

Fill out the fields:

:Server url: The URL to your server that you normally type into a web browser.
             For example, https://mycompany.ftrackapp.com
:Username: The username you were given to sign into the ftrack web application.
:API key: Your personal API key which you can find on :ref:`your account page
          <ftrack:using/getting_started/managing_account>` in the main ftrack
          web application.

Then press :guilabel:`Sign In`.

.. note::

    Once signed in successfully, you will not have to sign in again, even if you
    close and reopen the application, unless you sign out explicitly.

Signing Out
===========

If you need to sign out explicitly then you can do this from the  :term:`service
context menu` by selecting :guilabel:`Log Out & Quit`.
