Plugin directory
****************

ftrack Connect supports extensions through the use of a plugin directory. The
directory will be automatically searched for hooks where users can add their
own custom event processing, actions and locations.

The path for the :term:`default plugin directory` differs between platforms:

:OS X:
    ~/Library/Application Support/ftrack-connect-plugins

:Windows:
    C:\\Documents and Settings\\<User>\\Application Data\\Local Settings\\ftrack\\ftrack-connect-plugins

:Linux:
    ~/.local/share/ftrack-connect-plugins


An easy way of finding your :term:`default plugin directory` is to open the
ftrack connect menu and click `Open plugin directory`:

.. image:: /image/open_default_plugin_directory.png
    :align: center

This will create the directory if not already existing and open it in the
file browser. Downloaded Connect plugins can be unzipped and placed in this
directory.

    For development of plugins please refer to this
    :ref:`article <developing/plugins>`.

Environment variable
====================

Advanced users may want to control where Connect looks for plugins. It may be
because you want to centralise hooks on a network share for everyone in the
Company or just want to have them somewhere else than default.

By setting the `FTRACK_CONNECT_PLUGIN_PATH` you can add additional places
where plugin hooks are discovered. E.g::

    export FTRACK_CONNECT_PLUGIN_PATH=/Users/mattiaslagergren/Desktop/my-plugins
